## About the Video Course
	Nowadays, security plays an important part in securing your system or data. With over 750 automation modules, Ansible makes it easy for you to secure any part of your system, including setting firewalls, providing authentication to users and groups, and setting custom security policies. Ansible allows you to write automation procedures once and use them across your entire infrastructure.
The course starts with basic Ansible concepts and later progresses to the advanced features of Ansible 2. You'll start with the usage of Ansible with non-Linux targets, before then moving on to discuss some advanced uses of Ansible Tower. Ansible Tower makes it easy to control the way your infrastructure is configured via configuration definitions and continuous remediation
Next, we will look at secure user management with Ansible managing multiple user and different permissions. We will be closely looking at more complex hardening with STIG and CIS .
